#Problem/Solution summary

##Background

CoderFactory, based in Sydney, has two parts to it. the first part is as a coding school. Here they run many courses, one of which is what is known colloquially as a "Coding Bootcamp". Students study intensively for roughly six months and come out at the end as Junior Developers. The other side of CoderFactory is as a Dev House that does coding projects, big and small, for different clients.

##The problem

There are a few elements to this problem.

1. The Bootcamp is intensive. Students find it difficult to work over the duration of the course. This means that they have to rely on government handouts such as Austudy, which doesn't offer very much money, or on the generosity of their family to survive over the six moth period. Money can be tight for them, and it's an added concern on top of an already stressful course.
2. Students need to build up a portfolio of work in order to be more employable at the end of the course.
3. Students have little real world experience in dealing with clients.
4. The people working in the Dev House are fully qualified developers with multiple projects on the go at once. At times, however, a project comes in that's too low for them to do, but would be perfect for the Bootcamp students.

The main problem? How to connect the Bootcamp students to these smaller projects and give them 1) income, 2) a way to add to their portfolios, and 3) give them some real world experience.

##Solution

The solution is to create an app that connects the Bootcamp students to these clients with the smaller projects. This way the projects are still completed, the students gain real world experience, and they also gain some income while studying.
