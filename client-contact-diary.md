#Client Contact Diary

##11th June, 2016.

Spoke with the client today about what exactly it is that they need. Have received a list of requirements and desires of what they want.

- a job board that connects students with lower level jobs that are received by the CoderFactory Dev House.
- Went through basic requirements and a wish list.

Have received a means of keeping in contact with client throughout the project, and hashed out a basic timeline of when the project is to be delivered.
